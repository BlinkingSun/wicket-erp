# TODO

**Conforms to:** [GOALS.md](GOALS.md); [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-one-registry.md) (Proposed);
`docs/07-roadmap.md` (wave structure); `PLAN.md` §5, §6, §11.

*No dates. No durations. Progress is a gate that passes (`docs/07-roadmap.md` §5.4).
Sizes are S, M, L and describe scope, not calendar time.*

This backlog exists because the four goals in `GOALS.md` were added to a tree that did
not have them. It was produced by five independent analyses of the repository, each on a
separate slice, and then deduplicated. Where several analyses reached the same work from
different directions, the item says so, because that convergence is the evidence that
the item is real.

## How to use this file

**Stage 0 is the contribution product, and it comes first.** It needs no decision
from the owner. It stops documents from lying to contributors now. Do it first.
Most of Stage 0 landed in the 2026-09-14 swarm. T-01 and T-17 closed 2026-09-15.
**Remaining: T-13 (licence-identifier backfill).**

**Stage 1 is the keystone, and it is blocked on accepting
[ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-one-registry.md).** Seven separate items from four analyses
collapse into it. T-20 through T-27 have landed. Stage 2 (T-30) is the next coverage wave.

Stages 2 through 5 are ordered by dependency, not by importance. Stage 5 is the largest
and can only begin once Stage 2 gives it a catalogue to map onto.

---

## Stage 0 — Truth and intake

No dependencies. Every item here is small, and several fix statements in the repository
that are currently false.

| ID | Work | Size | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | **DONE.** Fill the conduct and security contacts | S | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:39` and `SECURITY.md:9` hold real addresses instead of placeholders; SECURITY states whether GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled |
| T-02 | **DONE.** Pull request template carrying the four-goal gate | S | `.github/pull_request_template.md` requires an answer or a reasoned "not applicable" for each goal, plus sign-off and local gate confirmation |
| T-03 | **DONE.** Issue templates and a published label set | S | Bug, feature, module proposal and request-for-comment forms exist; the label set is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| T-04 | **DONE.** Sign-off check in CI | S | `scripts/check-dco.sh` is wired in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `lint-policy`. A pull request whose commits lack `Signed-off-by` fails the build |
| T-05 | **DONE.** Request-for-comment path | S | A form and an index exist; `CONTRIBUTING.md` states which diffs require one before a pull request |
| T-06 | **DONE.** Goal-heading lint on pull request bodies | S | `scripts/check-pr-goals.sh` fails a pull request whose body omits a goal heading |
| T-07 | **DONE.** Repair dangling `_team/` citations in tracked files | M | No tracked file cites a path under `_team/` (other than this backlog's own history of the defect). Cites were retargeted to `research/` and `docs/` or restated inline |
| T-08 | **DONE.** Move the `_team` exclusion into the repository | S | `.gitignore` excludes `_team/` |
| T-09 | **DONE.** Correct the supported PostgreSQL floor | S | `docs/01-vision-and-scope.md` states 17 minimum, 18 tested, matching `docs/09-workspace-contract.md` |
| T-10 | **DONE.** Close the settled open questions in the vision | S | `docs/01-vision-and-scope.md` §8 records licence and DCO as settled by [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-license.md). The one-constant name claim is restated as false since the rename |
| T-11 | **DONE.** Stamp audience and status on every document | S | Product docs, ADRs, HANDOFF (historical), DESIGN, and research/README declare audience and status. HANDOFF no longer claims "no code has been written" as present tense |
| T-12 | **DONE.** Correct the stale hosted-CI wording | S | HANDOFF, README, and CONTRIBUTING agree that hosted Actions are on. Slice acceptance is `just ci-db` |
| T-13 | Licence identifier lint and backfill | S | Every source file carries its identifier and a lint enforces it. `CONTRIBUTING.md` §9 requires this today and no file complies. Backfill in one maintainer change before enabling the lint |
| T-14 | **DONE.** Unimplemented-macro scanner | S | `scripts/lint-unimplemented.sh` fails CI on a placeholder macro outside compile-fail fixtures |
| T-15 | **DONE.** The acceptance suite is outside the default gate | S | `README.md` §5 and `CONTRIBUTING.md` name `just ci` as the offline lint/lib gate and `just ci-db` as slice acceptance. `just ci` still ends in `test-lib` (`--lib`); that is now documented rather than mislabeled |
| T-16 | **DONE.** The build file describes a passing recipe as expected to fail | S | `justfile` no longer says ci-db is "expected RED until harness lands". Public CI's `just ci-db` is green |
| T-17 | **DONE.** Repository settings contradict the merge policy | S | GitHub `allow_squash_merge` is false, matching `CONTRIBUTING.md` §7 and `GOALS.md` GOV-5. Branch protection on `main` either enforces fast-forward or is recorded as ABSENT. Private vulnerability reporting is on, or `SECURITY.md:9-11` states it is off (see T-01). Closed 2026-09-15: `allow_squash_merge` and `allow_rebase_merge` set false; private vulnerability reporting enabled; `CONTRIBUTING.md` §7 and `SECURITY.md` updated to match. Two residuals recorded rather than hidden: `allow_merge_commit` stays true because GitHub refuses to disable every merge strategy (it is the only one that does not rewrite signed commits), and branch protection on `main` is **ABSENT** because GitHub has no fast-forward-only mode |
| T-18 | **DONE.** One writer per file per wave | S | `CONTRIBUTING.md` §7 and `AGENTS.md` state one writer per file per wave. Historical `integrate: merge` overlapping-ownership commits remain in git history; new waves must not add more |

---

## Stage 1 — The keystone: one registry

**Depends on:** nothing. **Blocks:** Stages 2, 3 and 5.

Governed by [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-one-registry.md). Three analyses found the manifest
drift independently; three found the dropped route method independently.

| ID | Work | Size | Depends | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-20 | **DONE.** Single manifest source. `compiled_in()` reads each `module.toml` rather than embedding a copy | M | — | No inline manifest strings remain in `crates/wicket-module/src/manifest.rs`; first-party modules are `include_str!` of `modules/*/module.toml`; calibration (no crate) is a fixture. A test fails on drift between the compiled-in catalogue and the file on disk |
| T-21 | **DONE.** Routes carry their method | S | T-20 | `[[routes]]` requires `method`; `ManifestRoute` and `ModuleRoute` store it; the local re-parse in `modules/items/src/lib.rs` is deleted |
| T-22 | **DONE.** Machines survive registration | M | T-20 | Declared machines are the machines the engine freezes, including not-required reasons; `register()` no longer clears them |
| T-23 | **DONE.** Mount reverse-diff lint | S | — | Landed as the interim step; T-24 replaced the lint so it binds capability ids rather than grepping `.route("` vs `MOUNTED` |
| T-24 | **DONE.** The capability table, and a router generated from it | L | T-21, T-23 | `crates/wicket-server/src/capabilities.rs` is the only route source. `http.rs` binds handlers by capability id. `scripts/lint-mounts.sh` fails a string-literal `.route("` and an unbound id |
| T-25 | **DONE.** Document generated from the table; parity test reads the router | M | T-24 | OpenAPI is generated from the capability table. `openapi_listed_paths_are_not_bare_404` asserts the served document equals the table and probes the live router |
| T-26 | **DONE.** Collapse the duplicate work-order namespace | S | T-23 | `/api/v1/work-orders` is the only prefix. `/api/v1/production/work-orders` is gone, not aliased |
| T-27 | **DONE.** Module manifest lint | M | T-20 | `scripts/lint-module-manifests.sh` fails when a first-party module's crate name, identifier, schema, canonical order, or either profile disagree. Wired into `just ci` |

---

## Stage 2 — Coverage

**Depends on:** Stage 1. Serves Goal 2.

Everything here is a capability that already exists in Rust and cannot be reached over
the wire. None of it is new functionality.

| ID | Work | Size | Depends | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-30 | **DONE.** Mount the module reads and writes that already have handlers | M | T-24 | Item list and patch, location list, tree, patch and deactivate, lot list, serial creation, work-order list, and the genealogy impact and job routes all respond |
| T-31 | Inventory writes | L | T-24 | Issues, moves, adjustments, document read and void are mounted with tests, or their declarations are removed in the same change |
| T-32 | Remaining machine edges | M | T-24 | Item obsolete, work-order cancel, and the document lifecycle edges each have an operation with optimistic concurrency |
| T-33 | Job status, enqueue and cancel | M | T-24 | A job identifier returned by a trace resolves. Today `modules/genealogy` returns one into a route that does not exist |
| T-34 | Kernel administration over HTTP | L | T-24 | Module registry, principals and roles, numbering, units of measure, and audit verification and export are reachable without linking the crate |
| T-35 | **Wave 0 DONE** (inputs described; signature meaning truthful). Typed bodies remain, gated on the schemars RFC. Document schemas and per-edge signature meaning | L | T-25 | Every operation carries request and response schemas; the signature meaning equals the edge's own meaning rather than the literal constant stamped on every transition today (`crates/wicket-server/src/openapi.rs:465-470`) |
| T-36 | Cursor pagination and filtering on list operations | M | T-30 | Limit and cursor are honoured; no handler hard-codes a null cursor on a non-empty page |
| T-37 | Rate limit and method-not-allowed envelope | S | — | The documented burst limit returns its error code, and an unsupported method returns the envelope. Both are specified in `docs/10-api-conventions.md` and neither is implemented |
| T-38 | CLI twin table and allowlist | M | T-34 | Every subcommand except process lifecycle has an operation or an allowlist row with a reason |
| T-39 | Custom fields for every entity that has definitions | M | T-24 | No longer restricted to items |
| T-40 | Document attach, link, history and legal hold | M | T-32 | Each public function has an operation or an allowlist row |
| T-41 | Print log and template version bump | S | T-24 | Routed, or made crate-private |
| T-42 | Ledger reversal, balance and projection verification | M | T-31 | No public ledger operation remains without a row or an allowlist entry |
| T-43 | **The Goal 2 gate: capability coverage test** | M | T-24, T-38 | Boots both profiles, walks engine edges, job kinds, module routes and CLI subcommands against the table, and fails on any capability with no row and no allowlist entry |
| T-44 | **DONE.** Golden OpenAPI fixture fails the build on path drift | S | T-23 | Closed 2026-09-15. `crates/wicket-server/tests/fixtures/openapi-operations.txt` holds the 57 **operations**, and `scripts/lint-openapi-fixture.sh` (wired into `just ci`) set-diffs it against the capability table, naming extras and missings. `just openapi-fixture` regenerates and is never a `ci` dependency; every sort is `LC_ALL=C` so regeneration is byte-stable across locales. The fixture keys on `(method, path)`, **not** paths: 57 operations span only 48 unique paths because 9 paths carry two methods, so a path-keyed fixture would miss method drift. A slice test also diffs the **served** document against the same fixture. The self-referential parity test named below is kept — its live-router bare-404 probe is independent — but it is no longer the only check |

---

### T-35 progress (2026-09-15)

**Wave 0 landed** (`10bf296`): 31 path parameters, 19 query fields from the handler structs, and
required headers declared **per route** — there is no `CapabilityKind`-based rule, and asserting
one was wrong in both directions. Signature meaning now reads the frozen engine
(`state.kernel().profile.signature_edges`), so `document(&AppState)` finally uses its state.

The document had stamped `meaning: "Released"` on all 10 transitions in **both** profiles. The
truth is **0 signed rows on `plain-shop`** and **3 on `regulated-device`** — every signature
claim in the plain-shop document was false, which for a Part 11 product is a claim a client would
have acted on. `setLotStatus` is omitted by id: it joins `(lot, release)` with
`releaseFromQuarantine`, but its handler also serves `hold` and `reject`.

**Wave 1 (typed request/response bodies) is gated on the `schemars` allow-list RFC** — GOV-7
requires an accepted request for comment plus the allow-list edit in the same change. Decision
recorded in ADR 0011. Residual from Wave 0: the header allowlists are hand-maintained and can
drift from handlers; a derivation or a drift test is a follow-up.

---

### Not in this backlog, and a first UI screen needs it

**Human-identifier lookup.** Item number, work-order number, lot identifier and serial
identifier resolved to ids. `design/mockup-shop-floor.png` has a scan box; an operator scans a
part number, not a UUID. No Stage 2 item delivers this.

Scoped 2026-09-15. **Shape: per-entity `GET /api/v1/{collection}/by-number/{n}`**, not a root
`/api/v1/resolve`. `docs/10:21` lets a module register only under its own prefix, so a
polymorphic resolver would have to be a kernel/composition-root operation fanning into four
module crates — and worse, the schema does not make a scanned string unique across kinds, and
**serials are not unique even within kind**, so a `{kind, id}` response would be a lie without an
owner-defined collision policy. Per-entity routes sidestep that entirely.

**Mixed cost, not one job.** `lots` already has a resolver, exported and unmounted — mounting it
is one `[[routes]]` row, one capability, one handler: hours. `items`, work orders and serials
need new crate functions. `location_id_by_code` / `site_id_by_code` are likewise crate-ready and
unmounted (shop-floor chrome shows `WC-LATHE-03`). Not kernel-crate work either way.

**Blocking permission gap, and it is a profile edit rather than a new key.** The seeded
`operator` bundle in **both** profiles has `items.view`, `production.view` and `genealogy.view`
but **not `lots.view`** (`profiles/plain-shop.toml:109-127`,
`profiles/regulated-device.toml:121-135`; the admin bundle has the same hole). Once by-number is
mounted, a seeded operator resolves a traveler number and an item number and then **403s on lot
and serial lookup — which is exactly the genealogy mockup's search box**. Granting `lots.view`
to `operator` is an owner decision about the permission model, not something a lane may do.

Evidence: `_team/reports/spike-ui-gap.md`, `_team/reports/spike-identifier-lookup.md`.

**`traceGenealogy` origin widening.** The mounted operation is narrower than the crate's real
origins (`serial` / `lot` / `posting`). A handler gap, hours not a module, and genealogy is the
best candidate for the first painted screen.

## Stage 3 — Agent affordances

**Depends on:** Stage 1. Serves Goal 1.

| ID | Work | Size | Depends | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-50 | Domain error tokens | M | — | An agent can distinguish a held lot from a malformed identifier without parsing English. Additive as a detail code; the envelope class is unchanged |
| T-51 | Legal next actions for a record | M | T-24 | Given a live record, the response lists exactly the outgoing edges legal from its current state, each with permission and signature requirement |
| T-52 | A named agent principal | L | — | A non-human session stamps an actor kind that is not a user, and the audit trail names the agent. Today every bearer session is stamped as a user (`crates/wicket-server/src/session.rs:219-225`) |
| T-53 | Dry run | L | T-51 | An illegal transition returns a structured refusal without writing; a legal one reports what would happen without persisting. **Open question first:** a dry run that skips hooks lies, and one that runs them may write. Decide the hook phase before building |
| T-54 | Module conformance suite | L | T-21, T-22 | An empty module fails it and an existing module passes it. Today a new module is judged by imitation |
| T-55 | Module scaffold generator | M | T-54 | Generates a module that fails its own conformance suite until filled in, and generates no directory the module contract cannot honour |
| T-56 | Publish and hash the introspection snapshot | M | T-24, T-51 | Modules, machines, edges, events, jobs and permissions are enumerable, and the snapshot is hashed into the configuration manifest |
| T-57 | Tool-call surface, optional | M | T-56 | Every tool name equals a mounted operation identifier. Do not start before T-56 or it will duplicate the document badly |
| T-58 | **DONE.** Extend the session-protocol lint to modules | S | — | `just lint-sql` first scan covers `modules/` as well as `crates/` |
| T-59 | **DONE.** Reconcile the module dependency rule with reality | S | T-05 | `PLAN.md` crate graph: Cargo manifests won. Modules depend on `wicket-module` AND the listed kernel crates. Enforcing "wicket-module published interfaces only" would reject every first-party module |
| T-60 | **DONE.** Resolve the phantom UI slot in the module contract | S | — | `docs/03-module-system.md` no longer requires a `ui/` tree. A UI tree is ABSENT (promised: Wave 3 UI) |

---

## Stage 4 — Operator documentation

**Depends on:** Stage 0 for truth repair. Mostly independent of Stages 1 to 3, so it can
run in parallel. Serves Goal 4a.

| ID | Work | Size | Depends | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-70 | **DONE.** Classify every environment variable the source reads | S | — | `docs/12-configuration.md` lists each with its path, classified as required at boot, optional at runtime, test-only or compile-time. `WICKET_REQUIRE_PG` is test-harness only. `WICKET_BLOB_ROOT` is the only hard production boot failure |
| T-71 | Operator documentation index | S | T-11 | An index maps the topics below to files, and the readme points operators there before the plan and design documents |
| T-72 | Prerequisites | M | T-71, T-09 | Operating systems, database version, and the contributor-only tools named as such |
| T-73 | Provisioning: database, the five roles, and the grants | M | T-72 | Reproduces the development role split with production credentials, and includes a check proving the application role cannot write the audit tables |
| T-74 | **DONE.** Configuration, and an example file that can actually boot | M | T-70 | `.env.example` includes `WICKET_BLOB_ROOT` and is a subset of `docs/12-configuration.md`. Development passwords only |
| T-75 | Choosing a profile | M | T-71 | A table generated from the profile files, stating that a required signature edge under a no-signature gate fails at startup |
| T-76 | First boot | M | T-73, T-74, T-75 | Each step carries a command, an expected result and an independent check. Distinguishes the product's migrate subcommand from the contributor recipe, which are different paths and desynchronise schema history if mixed |
| T-77 | Day one on the shop floor | L | T-76 | Receive, build, complete and trace, using only routes that exist, each with an expected status |
| T-78 | Day two: backup, restore, upgrade | M | T-76 | Uses the tools that exist today and names both the cluster and the blob root. A database-only restore is stated to be incomplete. The promised backup command is tagged absent |
| T-79 | Qualification, without overclaiming | M | T-76 | Maps the boot integrity check and the named tests onto qualification vocabulary while quoting the regulatory document's own refusal to claim validation |
| T-80 | Hardening and observability | M | T-73 | Trust model, listening address, blob permissions; and a troubleshooting table keyed by real symptoms |
| T-81 | Documentation lints | M | T-74, T-77 | CI fails when a variable in the source is missing from the configuration canon, when a procedure names a command that does not exist and is not tagged absent, or when a document claims validation |

---

## Stage 5 — Migration

**Depends on:** Stage 2 for a stable API to load through, and a published catalogue to
map onto. Serves Goal 3. This is the largest stage and the only one starting from
nothing.

| ID | Work | Size | Depends | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-90 | Mapping file schema and an empty first pack | S | — | Files validate against a schema; CI fails when a source field has no stated disposition |
| T-91 | Staging schema | M | T-90 | Raw payload, source key, freeze timestamp and extract run identifier, with forward and reverse migrations |
| T-92 | Incumbent extractor | L | T-91 | Authenticates, pins the endpoint and contract version, pages by key, and loads fixtures into staging without needing a live tenant |
| T-93 | Point-in-time quantity snapshot | M | T-92 | A freeze-window snapshot is captured as expected-balance rows |
| T-94 | Load units, items, sites and locations through the public API | L | T-92, T-43 | A fixture round-trips into the real tables through HTTP |
| T-95 | Load lots and serials with the identifier law enforced | M | T-94 | An identifier that fails a kernel law never lands in the kernel field; the original is preserved in a cross-reference |
| T-96 | Opening balances | L | T-93, T-95 | On-hand read back through the API matches the snapshot |
| T-97 | Open work orders | L | T-96 | Counts and issued quantities match the extract; the numbering counter is advanced past the imported maximum |
| T-98 | Custom field mapping | M | T-94 | Every incumbent attribute appears in the pack, mapped or explicitly dropped |
| T-99 | Imported evidence path | M | T-94 | Incumbent attachments and sign-off records land as evidence documents. **Zero rows are created in the signature table.** This is the line that must not be crossed |
| T-100 | Reconciliation report | M | T-96, T-97 | Quantity, open work orders, lot status and genealogy completeness produce a pass or fail; under the regulated profile an unexplained genealogy gap fails |
| T-101 | Cutover runbook | S | T-100 | Dry run, parallel run with the incumbent still the system of record, freeze, go-live, and a rollback that is simply staying on the incumbent |
| T-102 | Out-of-scope register | S | T-90 | Published in the run manifest up front. Includes the general ledger, credentials, live signatures, and every catalog-later module |
| T-103 | Adapter boundary and a second-incumbent skeleton | M | T-92 | Incumbent-specific strings appear only under that adapter's directory, enforced by a lint; the first incumbent is the only complete implementation |
| T-104 | Optional history replay | L | T-96, T-100 | Behind a flag, off by default except where the regulated profile requires genealogy on stock still held |

---

## Decisions the owner still owes this backlog

These block specific items and cannot be resolved by a contributor.

1. **Accept or reject [ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-one-registry.md).** All of Stage 1 hangs
   on it. Rejecting it means Goals 1 and 2 are pursued separately and some work is done
   twice; that is a legitimate choice, but it should be a chosen one.
2. **The agent actor model.** A new actor kind is clearer in a regulatory review; reusing
   the service principal with an acting-for field is a smaller change. Blocks T-52.
3. **Which internal functions are exempt from Goal 2.** The allowlist is the honesty
   mechanism. If it becomes a junk drawer, Goal 2 is dead. Blocks T-43.
4. **Whether install-time subcommands belong on the API at all,** given they run before
   the server binds. Blocks T-38.
5. **Opening balances only, or full history replay,** as the migration default. Regulated
   shops need genealogy for stock they still hold, and full replay may be too large to
   post through the API. Blocks T-104.
6. **Whether to wait for a bill-of-materials module** before claiming manufacturing
   migration. Without one, product structure cannot come across at all. This is the
   largest functional hole in Goal 3.
7. **How an outside pull request reaches the private mirror,** given the standing law
   that the mirror receives landings first. Blocks the merge policy in T-05.
8. **Repository merge settings.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` §7 and `GOALS.md` GOV-5 state
   squash-merge is disabled. The GitHub repository has `allow_squash_merge`,
   `allow_rebase_merge` and `allow_merge_commit` all true. The documents describe a
   rule the platform does not enforce. This is an owner Settings change, not a file
   change. Also decide: branch protection on `main` so the fast-forward rule is
   real, and whether private vulnerability reporting is on. Blocks T-17.
9. **Whether `just ci` must run the acceptance suite.** Resolved 2026-09-14 by
   the docs path (T-15): `just ci` is the offline lint/lib gate; `just ci-db` is
   slice acceptance. Reopen only if `ci` itself should grow a no-database
   integration-test recipe.
